Overall, studies investigating the impact of microgravity on stem cell function suggest that microgravity critically affects basic cell functions including alterations to cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, gene expression profiles, differentiation and apoptosis related pathways 218 , 223 , 232 , 241 , 242 , contributing to the growing concern that the health of both stem cells and terminally differentiated lineage populations is threatened during spaceflight exposure. Findings that highlight the inability of stem cells to differentiate towards certain lineages emphasize the detrimental effect of microgravity on tissue regenerative processes and the need to develop therapeutic countermeasures before long-duration spaceflight missions are attempted.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs), cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) have been sent to the ISS and returned for analysis. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics including their biology, stemness, and fate choice towards specific lineages were evaluated to ensure their maintenance of identity and safety (Table 1 ). These stem cells are vital for stem cell therapy including bone marrow transplant for the treatment of bone or blood cancers, and helping patients recover neurons and blood vessels after a stroke. Successfully growing stem cells in space and maintaining their stemness without differentiation into other downstream lineages while bringing them back to Earth in good condition can make these cells feasible for use in patients in the future (Fig.

These interactions are vital for forming hematopoietic niches that replicate physiological conditions more accurately. Cultures in microgravity favor the creation of three-dimensional spheroids, which support better differentiation and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, optimizing the hematopoiesis process. This capability is particularly valuable for developing precise experimental models and innovative cell therapies . Microgravity modulates hematopoiesis by influencing the differentiation, proliferation, and structural organization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Pluripotent stem cells exhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural organization, as microgravity optimizes conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expansion . This occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway activation, where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as BAD and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR.

Furthermore, it is hypothesized that MSC cultures maintained in microgravity may be used for cell-based therapy in diseases of the central nervous system. Results collected via gene expression profiling from the experiment ‚ÄúStroma-2‚Äù performed aboard the ISS showed that in-space mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs had higher expression of genes involved in neural development, neuron morphogenesis, and transmission of nerve impulse and synapse than MSCs grown on Earth 24 . Also, human MSCs cultured in simulated microgravity demonstrated therapeutic properties in a mouse model of acute injury via significantly higher expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic factors compared to MSCs cultured in normal gravity 25 . Brain-injured mice that were transplanted with MSCs cultured in microgravity showed greater motor functional recovery than those transplanted with MSCs cultured in normal gravity 26 .

Content:
Microgravity has provided significant insights into how this environment influences fundamental biological processes such as tissue regeneration and cell repair . Research conducted in real spaceflights and terrestrial simulations has demonstrated that microgravity impacts protein expression and the regulation of cellular pathways critical for the growth and regeneration of various stem cell types. One of the most notable pathways affected is the Hippo pathway, which plays a central role in cell proliferation and tissue damage response. Under microgravity conditions, this pathway is temporarily deactivated, creating a favorable state for cell proliferation and tissue repair. These effects have shown particular promise in regenerating organs such as the heart, with potential applications extending to other tissues . The replication of microgravity effects in terrestrial simulations opens new possibilities for exploring therapeutic treatments based on this phenomenon .

Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-ŒºG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts‚Äô health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-ŒºG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-ŒºG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs.

These findings are supported by another study in which cardiac spheres derived from hiPSCs in simulated microgravity culture showed enhanced production of highly enriched cardiomyocytes (99% purity) with high viability (90%), upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and survival and expected functional properties 5 . During iPSC generation, the gravity-induced tension present on Earth is absent under microgravity conditions, possibly making it easier for stem cells to multiply quicker. Cardiac regeneration is limited due to insufficient numbers of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs), low self-renewal potency and production of immature cardiomyocytes, among other reasons 42 . Current clinical trials which stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising 43 , 44 but are limited as a result of cells failing to engraft into the host tissue and use of progenitor cells restricted in potency 45 .

Microgravity significantly influences cell proliferation and functionality, representing a transformative advancement for biomedical research and regenerative medicine . In studies with pancreatic islets and neural crest stem cells, exposure to microgravity notably enhanced cell proliferation, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. For instance, pancreatic beta cells exhibited a 45% increase in proliferation after two weeks of microgravity exposure compared to controls under normal gravity conditions . Microgravity not only boosts cell growth but also modulates specific functions. For example, pancreatic beta cells cultured under microgravity showed a significant increase in insulin secretion, suggesting potential applications in developing therapies for metabolic diseases such as diabetes . Furthermore, co-culturing stem cells with pancreatic islets under microgravity improved cell viability by 20%, highlighting its ability to create a favorable environment for cell development .

As for adult stem cells, they are rare, undifferentiated stem cells which replenish cells and contribute to growth and repair of tissue by giving rise to progenitor cells which differentiate into the required cell types. Adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skin stem cells (SSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) 18 . With current tissue engineering technologies and advancements in gene editing techniques, stem cells can be remodeled into three-dimensional organoids and tissue structures, further exacerbating their use in personalized regenerative applications 19 . Stem cell-based therapies are a possible treatment for age-related conditions including stroke, dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, among other conditions and injuries. However, such treatments may require large amounts of stem cells, and this is difficult to achieve since expanding stem cells for therapies remains a challenge 20 .

The formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is a critical aspect of these improvements. Unlike two-dimensional cultures, 3D models more accurately replicate human physiological conditions, allowing for complex cell‚Äìcell and cell‚Äìenvironment interactions essential for differentiation, proliferation, and functionality. Beta cells in 3D models not only proliferated more rapidly but also maintained enhanced functionality, as demonstrated by increased insulin secretion . At the molecular level, microgravity appears to modulate key signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and mTOR, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. While further studies are needed to confirm their specific roles in beta cells and neural crest stem cells, these findings underscore microgravity‚Äôs ability to influence fundamental processes and optimize cell culture conditions .

Investigating the effects of microgravity in space on the regulation of NSCs and their commitment to a specific lineage can offer benefits to patients on Earth for cell replacement therapies and recovery of CNS structure and function. This can be done by using donor cells from the patients themselves to address neurodegenerative and development disorders including cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis, and then developing personalized treatments for them. In addition to this, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) based transcriptomic profiling revealed that NSCs maintained greater stemness ability during spaceflight via elevation of markers for stemness including Sox2, Pax6 , and Notch1 despite reduction in growth rate. Also, the increased expression of mature neuron marker Map2 and decrease in astrocyte marker Gfap and the oligodendrocyte markers Gal and Olig2 demonstrated NSCs‚Äô tendency to differentiate into neurons in space.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human iPSCs were cultured on the ISS and then returned to Earth. Analysis of these cells showed that they preserved their stemness and were able to proliferate in space while also remaining as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended in the same culture medium in space. These in-space NSCs were able to maintain their ability to become young neurons when cultured in neuronal specification media (NSM) upon return, indicating that exposure to microgravity in space did not change their potential to choose the neuronal fate. Additionally, neuroblasts proliferated for over a week when placed in NSM before deciding to mature 13 . These findings show that microgravity is an excellent tool to increase neural cell numbers without the need to perform genetic manipulations of long-term treatments with mitogens. This is relevant to advancing human health on Earth since neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from loss of a specific cell population and perhaps in-space grown NSCs can be a potential solution.

Under microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem cells demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading to improved formation of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in a notable increase in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and differentiation processes . Transcriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of thousands of genes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1. RUNX1 is essential for establishing hematopoietic stem cells, SOX17 for maintaining pluripotency and differentiation into hematopoietic lineages, and GATA1 for the maturation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. These gene expression patterns suggest that microgravity creates a favorable environment for optimizing hematopoiesis . At the cellular level, microgravity influences DNA replication by promoting the expression of replication machinery genes such as helicases and polymerases.

Microgravity significantly impacts stem cell function, affecting basic cellular processes such as cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, gene expression profiles, differentiation, and apoptosis-related pathways [1]. Overall, it critically influences cell proliferation and functionality [2].

For some stem cell types, microgravity can be beneficial. It favors the creation of three-dimensional spheroids, which supports better differentiation and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), optimizing hematopoiesis. This includes enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural organization of pluripotent stem cells, primarily through PI3K-Akt pathway activation that enhances cell survival [3]. HSCs also demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading to increased active hematopoietic cells and optimized expansion and differentiation. Transcriptomic analyses indicate that microgravity creates a favorable environment for optimizing hematopoiesis by activating genes like RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1 [4].

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured in microgravity have shown higher expression of genes related to neural development and nerve impulse transmission. Human MSCs in simulated microgravity demonstrated increased anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic factors, which led to greater motor functional recovery in brain-injured mice transplanted with these cells [5]. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have shown enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and larger cell diameters in space microgravity [6]. Human iPSC-derived NSCs preserved their stemness and proliferated in space, maintaining their potential to differentiate into neurons upon return to Earth. This suggests microgravity could be a tool to increase neural cell numbers without genetic manipulations [7]. Cardiac spheres derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in simulated microgravity culture produced highly enriched and viable cardiomyocytes with upregulated proliferation and survival genes, possibly due to the absence of gravity-induced tension [8]. Pancreatic beta cells and neural crest stem cells also show enhanced proliferation in three-dimensional cultures under microgravity, with pancreatic beta cells exhibiting a 45% increase in proliferation and increased insulin secretion, and improved cell viability when co-cultured with stem cells [2]. The formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is crucial, as they better replicate physiological conditions and enhance differentiation, proliferation, and functionality, while also modulating key signaling pathways like PI3K-Akt and mTOR [9].

However, microgravity can also have detrimental effects, threatening the health of stem cells and terminally differentiated populations. It highlights an inability of stem cells to differentiate towards certain lineages, which negatively impacts tissue regenerative processes [1]. There is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the regenerative potential of various stem cell types, with both benefits and disadvantages reported for MSCs, HSCs, and NSCs, and reduced regenerative potential reported for embryonic stem cells. Additionally, simulated microgravity can inhibit osteogenesis of MSCs while increasing adipogenesis [10]. Furthermore, space microgravity exposure led to frequent abnormal cell division in NSCs, including incomplete cell division and multi-daughter cell division [6].

Studying stem cells in space uncovers mechanisms otherwise undetected under normal gravity, offering potential for leveraging microgravity to advance cellular therapeutics [11].
