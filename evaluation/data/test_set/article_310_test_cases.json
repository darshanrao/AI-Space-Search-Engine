In the **soleus muscle**, which experienced a 19% decrease in weight, there was a **decreased expression of IRS2** (Insulin receptor substrate 2), a major downstream insulin signaling component. This suggests that insulin alterations contributed to a decline in protein synthesis, promoting muscle atrophy [1]. In contrast, the **EDL muscle** showed **activated insulin receptor signaling** (z-score: 2.52) and an upregulation of insulin-induced ACACA, an enzyme involved in lipogenesis, indicating an **insulin-responsive state** [1]. Overall, the majority of insulin signaling genes at the intersection of these two muscles were regulated in opposite directions, highlighting their distinctive responses to spaceflight [2]. The EDL muscle also displayed an enrichment for growth pathways, while the soleus muscle declined in size [3].",

          "answer_markdown": "Spaceflight induces significant alterations in both insulin and estrogen signaling in the mouse liver, which are intricately linked to the development of hepatic steatosis and mitochondrial dysfunction [1], [2].\n\n**Hepatic Steatosis:**\nSpaceflight leads to the **inhibition of insulin receptor signaling** in the liver, with downregulation of key components like INSR, AKT1, and AKT2 [2]. This inhibition results in **dysglycemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis** [2]. Hepatic steatosis itself is a direct consequence of insulin resistance and can create a vicious cycle by exacerbating it [3]. The SREBP pathway, known to be involved in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), was positively enriched, and genes like INSR, IRS1, AKT1, and AKT2 were among the top enriched genes for hepatic steatosis [6]. Impaired **estrogen signaling** (z-score < -2) also contributes to hepatic insulin resistance [3], [5].\n\n**Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**\nSpaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is closely tied to these hormonal changes [4]. The downregulation of **PPARGC1A (PGC-1Î±)**, a master regulator of metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in the liver, affecting both insulin and estrogen gene expression changes [4]. Estrogen plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and biogenesis [4]. In the liver, the **estrogen signaling network showed downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, complex II, and ATP synthase genes** [4], [5]. This impairment of estrogen signaling can directly hamper oxidative phosphorylation, particularly affecting complex I [5]. Additionally, inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) was observed, further indicating derangement of mitochondrial activity [5]. The identification of **MFN2**, a mitochondrial fusion protein associated with insulin signaling and oxidative stress in NAFLD, further highlights the connection between these pathways and mitochondrial health [6].\n\nIn summary, spaceflight disrupts insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, while simultaneously impairing estrogen signaling, which directly contributes to both hepatic insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction through the downregulation of key mitochondrial complexes and regulators.",

Spaceflight induced **inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling** (z-scores: -3.772 and -5.859, respectively), leading to **hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis** [1], [2], [11]. Downregulation of insulin receptor (INSR) and downstream kinases (AKT1, AKT2) was observed [2]. Furthermore, **mitochondrial dysfunction** was evident, with downregulation of PPARGC1A (PGC-1Î±) and genes for mitochondrial complex I, complex II, and ATP synthase within the estrogen signaling network [4], [11]. Proteomics data also confirmed the liver as having the most insulin and estrogen-related protein abundance changes [12].\n*   **Muscles (Soleus vs. EDL):** Insulin signaling showed **distinct responses**. The **soleus muscle** experienced atrophy and a 19% decrease in weight, with decreased expression of IRS2, suggesting reduced protein synthesis [5]. In contrast, the **extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle** showed activated insulin receptor signaling and upregulated ACACA, indicating an insulin-responsive state and enrichment for growth pathways [5], [6]. Estrogen receptor signaling also displayed diverse actions, with ESR1 upregulated in soleus (possibly compensatory) and ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG upregulated in EDL [7], [8].\n*   **Skin:** Differences in pathway enrichment scores were observed between female and male mice. In male mice, genes involved in tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix, wound healing, and collagen synthesis (e.g., **ACE, FN1, IGFBP5, MMP3, COL6A3, COL6A1, COL1A1, COL5A1, BGN, FASN, LOXL2**) were downregulated [13]. Insulin receptor (INSR), IRS2, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and ESRRG were upregulated in male dorsal skin [14].\n*   **General:** Circadian rhythm genes (e.g., ARNTL, NPAS2, NR1D2, PER2, PER3) were commonly altered across various tissues, indicating a global effect of spaceflight on the circadian clock and its association with insulin signaling [15].\n\n**Affected Tissues and Key Molecular Changes in Humans:**\n*   **Blood (Plasma cfRNAs, PBMCs):** Changes in insulin resistance-related genes were detected both inflight and postflight [16]. Postflight, **upregulation of insulin signaling genes** (e.g., AKT1, RARRES2) and enriched insulin secretion and PI3K/AKT signaling were observed [16], [17]. Glucagon signaling was also upregulated postflight, potentially indicating stress and insulin resistance [16]. Estrogen signaling pathways were enriched with insulin-related genes, with ESR1 showing an initial upregulation followed by downregulation postflight [17], [18]. Genes related to steroidogenesis, such as CYP17A1, were upregulated postflight, explaining enriched ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis pathways [18], [19]. Mitochondrial complex I subunits (MT-ND1, MT-ND6) and fatty acid metabolism genes (CD36, CPT1A) were upregulated during spaceflight [17]. The leptin receptor (LEPR) was downregulated postflight [19].\n*   **Skin:** Human skin samples showed increased enrichments in insulin resistance genes and decreased enrichments in estrogen and insulin signaling genes postflight [20]. Sex differences were noted, with insulin resistance-linked genes being more enriched in females in the postflight vascular compartment and outer epidermis [21].\n\n**Potential Health Implications:**\nThese widespread alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling forebode **metabolic comorbidities** [18]. Disease enrichment analysis in rodents highlighted **diabetes mellitus and fatty liver** as top enriched diseases, while in humans, **obesity and hypertension** were prominent [10], [16]. The findings suggest a heightened risk for conditions like insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, muscle atrophy, and potentially impaired skin integrity [1], [3], [5], [13]. The prominent immune-mediated cytokine and adipokine response also points to broader systemic effects [17]. The study emphasizes the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel to ensure the success of future interplanetary missions, with insulin and estrogen signaling identified as potential targets for countermeasures [1], [18].",
