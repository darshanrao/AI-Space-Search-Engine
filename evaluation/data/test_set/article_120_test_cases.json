This dysfunction was observed immediately after flight and **persisted for 1 day post-flight**, but **normalized within 5 days** of ground recovery [2], [5], [6]. Importantly, these changes occurred **without any gross structural alterations** in arterial medial wall thickness or maximal luminal diameter [2], [3], [7].\n*   **Mesenteric Veins:** Spaceflight also **blunted NE-evoked constriction** in mesenteric veins, leading to greater intraluminal diameters at each pressure in spaceflight mice compared to ground controls [1], [2], [8].\n\n**Proposed Mechanisms:**\n*   The primary mechanism for the impaired vasoconstriction in both arteries and veins is attributed to an **impairment of the ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated intracellular Ca 2+ release mechanism** from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle cells [1], [2], [3], [4]. This is supported by reduced caffeine-induced vasoconstriction and significantly lower RyR-3 mRNA levels (with a tendency for lower RyR-2 mRNA) in mesenteric arteries from spaceflight mice [2], [3], [4]. For veins, diminished α-receptor density and down-regulation of ryanodine receptors are also suggested as potential mechanisms [9].\n\n**Functional Implications for Astronauts:**\n*   These vascular changes could compromise the ability of astronauts to **augment peripheral vascular resistance (PVR)** and **maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)** during orthostatic stress upon return to Earth, contributing to orthostatic hypotension [1], [2], [10].\n*   The impaired arterial and venous constriction could also **diminish the central mobilization of blood volume**, thereby affecting venous filling pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output during orthostatic and exercise stress [2], [10]. This dysfunction in splanchnic vasculature is considered to play a fundamental role in altered hemodynamics during exercise and orthostasis upon return to Earth [11].",
