          "answer_markdown": "The study proposes a mechanism where AtANN1 plays a key role in mediating plant heat stress responses, primarily through its involvement in **intracellular calcium signaling** and subsequent **downstream gene expression** [1], [2].\n\nInitially, an elevated environmental temperature is perceived by **membrane sensors, such as cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs)**, leading to an initial influx of calcium into the cytosol [3]. This **increased cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) then activates cytosolic AtANN1**, recruiting it directly to membranes [3]. The association of AtANN1 with membranes is hypothesized to either **form a calcium channel itself or activate another calcium channel**, thereby allowing for a greater influx of calcium into the cell, which is needed to fully activate plant heat-shock responses [3].\n\nThis sustained increase in [Ca2+]cyt is crucial for the heat stress response. Evidence for this includes the finding that the **heat-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase is greatly reduced in ann1 mutants and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutants** [1], [4]. Consequently, the **heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and heat-shock factors (HSFs) is inhibited or significantly attenuated** in ann1/ann2 double mutants, leading to their hypersensitivity to heat stress [1], [2], [5].",
