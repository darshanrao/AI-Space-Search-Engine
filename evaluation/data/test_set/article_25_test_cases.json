These high-energy particles (HZEs, protons, heavy ions) are **energetic enough to penetrate spacecraft shielding and bodily tissues**, making them very damaging to biological tissue due to their high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) values, which allows them to induce complex double-strand breaks [2], [3].\n\nIn contrast, Solar Particle Events (SPEs) consist mainly of **95% protons, electrons, HZE ions, and alpha particles**, but are characterized by **high flux and low energy** [4]. This low energy means that **spacecraft shielding is much more effective at blocking SPE radiation**, and most residual SPE radiation can be absorbed by superficial tissues. Consequently, **skin doses from SPEs are 5–10 times higher than internal organs**, making them more likely to cause skin lesions and hematological/immunological disturbances, though they rarely result in high total dose exposures [4].",

While the overall number of female astronauts is low, making epidemiological studies difficult [5], significant measures are in place.\n\nDuring the final astronaut selection process, female candidates undergo **pelvic and abdominal sonography, colposcopy, gynecologic examination, Pap smears, and screening for high-risk HPV** [6]. Any gynecologic malignancy, except successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ, is disqualifying [6]. Pre-flight medical evaluations are even more comprehensive, including **abdominal and pelvic ultrasound studies and breast MRI**, with all female astronauts receiving a **pre-flight transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** [7], [8]. If endometrial stripe abnormalities are noted on TVUS, terrestrial guidelines for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer screening are considered [8]. Astronauts are also encouraged to obtain the **HPV vaccine series** and undergo **genetic screening for hereditary cancer syndromes** based on personal and family history [8], [10]. Counseling regarding the known effects of hormonal contraception on breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers is also part of pre-flight discussions [8], [9].\n\nFor post-flight screening, more conservative recommendations include **annual mammography with adjunctive ultrasound for dense breast tissue, or alternating mammography with biennial breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**. Additionally, **earlier and more frequent colon cancer screening (starting at 40 years and every 5 years thereafter)**, and an **annual skin exam by a dermatologist** are recommended [11]. The new radiation exposure limit is now a universal standard of less than 600 mGy for all ages and sexes, reflecting an updated approach to radiation risk management [12].",

          "answer_markdown": "The primary space-environmental factors affecting astronaut health are **microgravity and ionizing radiation**, which are identified as the most significant hazards during space travel, especially for long-duration missions [1], [2].\n\n**Impact of Microgravity:**\nMicrogravity leads to complex biological and systemic changes, including remodeling of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems [3], [4]. Its effects are significant, global, and amplified with mission duration, though research into sex/gender-related differences and the female reproductive system's response is limited [4]. Microgravity exposure poses multiple female reproductive health concerns, including effects on **gonadal function and fertility**, potentially exacerbated by secondary stressors like sleep disruption [5], [6]. Studies on mouse embryos flown in space revealed **impaired blastocyst formation and quality, severe DNA damage, and global hypomethylation** [7]. At a cellular level, microgravity can influence processes involved in carcinogenesis such as **differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival, apoptosis, and adhesion** [8]. It has also been observed to **impair radiation-induced DNA damage response**, increase radiosensitivity, and dysregulate important signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K) commonly involved in cancer [9]. Simulated microgravity has been shown to **decrease proliferation and migration in human endometrial stromal cells** [10].\n\n**Impact of Ionizing Radiation:**\nIonizing radiation, stemming from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt, is a known carcinogen [11], [12]. It can directly or indirectly damage cells by causing **single-strand or double-strand DNA breaks**, which can lead to cell death or mutation [13]. An **increased rate of carcinogenesis** is a primary concern for long-duration spaceflight [12]. The **ovary is extremely radiosensitive**, and radiation exposure can induce temporary or permanent infertility, with permanent sterility requiring doses ranging from 3500–20,000 mGy [14]. Animal studies have demonstrated that **heavy ion irradiation can induce ovarian tumors** in mice [15], [16]. Furthermore, DNA damage in human cervical carcinoma cells has been shown to correlate with spaceflight duration [17]. Spaceflight can also cause **immune dysregulation**, including impaired NK cell function and reduced T cell activation, which may lead to the **reactivation of latent oncogenic viruses** like HPV, Epstein–Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus, potentially increasing cancer risk [17], [18].\n\nOverall, the review highlights a **scarcity of knowledge** regarding the combined impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, largely due to the insufficient number of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation [19]. The male and female gonads are noted as among the most sensitive tissues to radiation [19].",
