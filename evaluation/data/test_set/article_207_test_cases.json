The rationale is based on animal studies showing **increased AmB serum concentrations and higher rates of nephrotoxicity** in obese rats and rabbits, attributed to poor distribution of the drug in adipose tissue [3]. Additionally, women have a higher body fat rate, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury caused by liposomal-AmB [3].

Risk factors include **immunocompromised states** (e.g., HIV infection, leukemia, cancer), widespread use of immunosuppressive agents, prolonged use of central venous catheters, exposure to bird excrement, contact with animals, and **prior surgery** [2], [3], [4].\n\n*   **Clinical Presentation**: The most common symptom is **headache**, reported by nearly all patients, while fever is less frequent (31%) [5]. Other symptoms include altered mental state, nausea, vomiting, and increased intracranial pressure [5].\n\n*   **Diagnostic Methods**: While culture and API® strip assimilation tests are used, **mass spectrometry (e.g., VITEK MS)** is considered reliable for identification [6], [7]. However, for rare species, **rRNA sequencing (D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit rRNA or internal transcribed spacer)** is crucial to prevent misidentification due to phenotypic similarities [6], [8], [9].\n\n*   **Treatment Strategies**: There are no evidence-based guidelines due to the infrequency of disease [6], [10]. However, **Amphotericin B (AmB)-based treatment is the first choice**, as *C. albidus* and its related species are consistently sensitive to it [6], [11]. Recommendations include using **liposomal-AmB** over AmB deoxycholate for safety and faster CSF sterilization, administering at least 1g of AmB during prolonged treatment, and combining AmB with **5-fluorocytosine** to reduce toxicity and relapse rates [11]. For obese patients, calculating the liposomal-AmB dose using **ideal bodyweight** is recommended for efficacy and safety [12], [13].",
