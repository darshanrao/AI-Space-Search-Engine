While protons are typically assigned an RBE of 1.1, suggesting similar biological effects to photons at the same dose [PMC6213004:1--introduction:f20f4451], this study found that **gamma rays were generally more effective** than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation [PMC6213004:1--introduction:0a531a81], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:89fe4737], [PMC6213004:abstract:1197d07d]. This suggests that for viral reactivation, the RBE for protons may be less than 1.1, and potentially even smaller than 1 for carbon and iron ions [PMC6213004:3--discussion:89fe4737].

Simulations illustrate that even for the same physical dose, the **energy deposition patterns** (electron tracks for gamma rays vs. densely ionizing core and penumbra for heavy ions) are quite different, which could lead to varying biological effects like viral reactivation [PMC6213004:2--results:48b55eb1], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:b14e8713].",

          "answer_markdown": "The study investigated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation in **Akata cells**, an EBV-producer line, by exposing them to **four types of radiation**: 137 Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions [PMC6213004:abstract:ccdbd1e7], [PMC6213004:4--materials-and-methods:ab669c04], [PMC6213004:4--materials-and-methods:c124b38e]. Cells were treated with acute doses of **0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 Gy** [PMC6213004:abstract:ccdbd1e7], [PMC6213004:4--materials-and-methods:c124b38e]. Samples were harvested at various time points up to 20 days post-irradiation to assess **lytic gene transcription (BZLF1 and BLLF1), EBV viral load, cell viability, and cell size** [PMC6213004:2--results:a0311d7e], [PMC6213004:2--results:c6d5bb92], [PMC6213004:4--materials-and-methods:d2f1fc6c].\n\nThe **main conclusions** are:\n1.  **Viral Reactivation:** All four types of radiation significantly induced EBV lytic gene transcription and increased median viral loads compared to controls, with effects detected as early as **four days post-exposure** [PMC6213004:abstract:ccdbd1e7], [PMC6213004:2--results:c6d5bb92], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:1841a719]. Gamma radiation generally produced the **highest initial rates of reactivation**, peaking around day 4 [PMC6213004:2--results:ac55a841], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:e766af48]. High-energy particles (protons, carbon, iron) also induced initial transcription at day 4 but often showed **more sustained or later peaks** (e.g., day 12 for carbon and iron) [PMC6213004:2--results:d8c4dc68], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:e766af48]. This reactivation occurred **in vitro without the involvement of the immune system** [PMC6213004:abstract:ccdbd1e7], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:89fe4737].\n2.  **Cell Viability and Size:** Cell viability was highly variable but showed similar trends across radiation types and doses, with significant decreases noted in some cases (e.g., gamma at 0.1 Gy, protons at various doses, iron at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy on day 8), but **carbon ions did not show significant changes** [PMC6213004:abstract:ccdbd1e7], [PMC6213004:2--results:982b7e2f]. Cell size measurements were also highly variable, making it difficult to discern consistent effects, though gamma-irradiated samples generally showed reduced cell size [PMC6213004:2--results:982b7e2f], [PMC6213004:2--results:585531b8].\n3.  **Challenge to RBE Concept:** The finding that gamma rays were generally more effective than protons, carbon, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation **challenges the common RBE concept** (e.g., RBE of 1.1 for protons) [PMC6213004:1--introduction:0a531a81], [PMC6213004:abstract:1197d07d], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:89fe4737]. The authors suggest that differences in **radiation track structure** and energy deposition patterns, rather than just physical dose, may explain these varying biological effects [PMC6213004:1--introduction:0a531a81], [PMC6213004:2--results:585531b8], [PMC6213004:3--discussion:b14e8713].",
