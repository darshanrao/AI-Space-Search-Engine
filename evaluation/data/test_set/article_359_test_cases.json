They also enable **high-throughput studies** and provide a **well-characterized homogeneous cell population** for high experimental reproducibility [1].\n*   **Disadvantages**: They often **lack differentiation characteristics** of the *in vivo* parental tissue, including 3-D architecture, phenotypic characteristics, multicellular complexity, and function [1]. Most are **not polarized** and do not express distinctive apical and basolateral markers, which limits studies requiring cell polarity [2]. Additionally, cells can **easily detach from their substrate upon infection**, limiting long-term studies [2].\n\n**Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) Models:**\n*   **Advantages**: They **closely mimic key aspects of the *in vivo* architecture, cellular composition, and physiology** of airway epithelium [3]. Primary airway cells grown as ALI are **pseudostratified**, contain a **highly differentiated mixed epithelial cell population** (including basal, ciliated, and goblet cells), express relevant **cilia coverage and beating**, **mucus production**, **polarity**, and **tight junctions** [4]. They are also **amenable to co-culturing multiple cell types** and incorporating **biomechanical forces** [5].\n*   **Disadvantages**: They are **expensive**, **time-consuming** (e.g., 3–4 weeks for primary airway epithelial cells to mature), and have **limited high-throughput capabilities** [4]. While their overall morphology resembles *in vivo* tissue, differences in the proportion of lung epithelial cells compared to the native organ have been reported [4].",

          "answer_markdown": "In damaged mucosal epithelium, changes in epithelial cell polarity and the exposure of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins significantly facilitate *P. aeruginosa* colonization and infection:\n\n1.  **Loss of Epithelial Cell Polarity**: When epithelium is damaged, its normal polarity is affected. This leads to **basolateral epithelial cell surfaces becoming accessible**, which is the preferred site for *P. aeruginosa* binding [1], [2]. Furthermore, basolateral receptors are **enriched at the apical side of repairing (incompletely polarized) epithelium**, enhancing *P. aeruginosa* adhesion, invasion, and cytotoxicity compared to polarized epithelium [1], [3]. *P. aeruginosa* can even actively enhance the expression of these basolateral receptors at the apical surface to facilitate its uptake [1]. Apical receptors/binding sites such as asialoGM1, fibronectin, and integrin α5β1 are also **transiently enriched** at the surface of spreading and repairing respiratory epithelial cells [4]. The absence of functional apical CFTR in repairing epithelium also impedes effective clearance of infected cells [4].\n\n2.  **Exposure of Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Proteins**: Breaching of the epithelial barrier through injury or disruption of tight junctions directly exposes the basolateral surface to *P. aeruginosa* [2], [5]. ECM proteins of the basement membrane, such as **fibronectin, laminin, and collagens**, become accessible and enable *P. aeruginosa* adhesion, contributing to colonization and dissemination [2], [5]. Additionally, cellular ECM components at the apical surface, whose expression is induced in repairing epithelium, also bind *P. aeruginosa* [2]. This enhanced binding to both basolateral and potentially apical ECM components is a critical part of the infectious disease process in damaged tissue [6].",

          "answer_markdown": "The healthy mucosal epithelium employs a multi-faceted defense system against *P. aeruginosa* infections, involving physical, chemical, and cellular factors. However, in disease states like cystic fibrosis (CF) or epithelial injury, these protective mechanisms are compromised, creating an environment conducive to infection.\n\n**I. Healthy Mucosal Epithelium Protection:**\n*   **Physical Factors**: The primary physical barriers include **tight junctions** that seal the epithelial paracellular pathway and the **mucociliary escalator** in the airways [1]. This system, comprising a biphasic mucus layer and continuously beating cilia, efficiently captures and clears over 90% of inhaled particles [1].\n*   **Chemical Factors**: Mucus contains **antimicrobial substances** such as β-defensins and lactoferrins [2]. The microenvironment maintains **normoxia**, **low iron levels**, a **neutral pH**, and appropriate **bicarbonate and phosphate levels**, all of which keep *P. aeruginosa* in a manageable, non-virulent phenotype [2]. Epithelial cells also produce enzymatic factors like **paraoxonases** that degrade *P. aeruginosa* quorum sensing molecules [3].\n*   **Cellular Factors**: **Innate immune cells** (e.g., macrophages) are present at basal levels [2]. Epithelial cells directly defend against *P. aeruginosa* and control neutrophil recruitment [2]. The **CFTR receptor** binds *P. aeruginosa*, leading to bacterial internalization, apoptosis/exfoliation of infected cells, and phagocyte recruitment [4]. In healthy, polarized epithelium, basolateral receptors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are not exposed [4]. The **indigenous microbiota** also contributes to host defense through nutrient competition, immune cell activation, and epithelial cell differentiation [3].\n\n**II. Compromised Factors in Disease States:**\n\n**A. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Lung Environment:**\n*   **Physical**: The most significant compromise is the **absent mucociliary clearance** due to dysfunctional CFTR and imbalances in bicarbonate levels, leading to a **thick, dehydrated mucus layer** [5], [6]. This results in *P. aeruginosa* exhibiting **loss of motility**, **mucus-associated biofilm formation**, **anaerobic metabolism**, and **resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides** [5]. **Lower fluid shear levels** also promote self-aggregative biofilms and enhanced alginate production [6].\n*   **Chemical**: The CF lung is characterized by **microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions**, **high iron levels**, **lower pH**, and **high reactive oxygen species (ROS)** [6], [7]. These conditions trigger antibiotic resistance, alginate production, biofilm formation, pyocyanin production, and the mucoid phenotype [6], [7].\n*   **Cellular**: **No/dysfunctional CFTR** diminishes host clearance and affects mucus properties [8]. **High protease levels** (e.g., neutrophil elastase) degrade antimicrobial peptides, further impeding clearance [7]. The altered **microbiome** in CF lungs can increase *P. aeruginosa* virulence [9].\n\n**B. Epithelial Injury (e.g., bronchoscopy, intestinal surgery):**\n*   **Physical**: **Disruption of tight junctions** enables paracellular migration and exposes basolateral receptors, which is the preferred infection site for *P. aeruginosa* [10]. **Exposure of ECM proteins** (fibronectin, laminin, collagens) of the basement membrane allows *P. aeruginosa* adhesion and invasion [10]. Repairing epithelial cells are not ciliated, leading to **local disruption in mucociliary clearance** [10].\n*   **Chemical**: Stress-induced changes like **opioid release**, **low phosphate levels**, or **higher pH** can trigger a lethal *P. aeruginosa* phenotype [11]. **Hypoxia** profoundly affects virulence traits, including PA-I lectin expression and enhanced binding [11].\n*   **Cellular**: **Basolateral membrane receptors** (e.g., heparan sulfate chains) are enriched at the apical side of repairing tissue, and apical receptors like asialoGM1, fibronectin, and integrin α5β1 are transiently enriched [12]. Repairing epithelium **does not express apical CFTR**, impeding effective clearance [12].",
