This classification is supported by evidence of their mixed prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties. \n\n**Eukaryotic microvesicular properties** are indicated by:\n*   The presence of **conserved eukaryotic proteins with microvesicular signatures**, including orthologs of *Drosophila* and mammalian extra- and intracellular vesicle components, and membrane proteins [3], [4], [11].\n*   The proteome contains **transmembrane and vesicle transport proteins** (e.g., Na/K pump, SERCA calcium pump, H+-ATPase, Rab proteins), suggesting functional similarities to eukaryotic extracellular microvesicles that transfer proteins between cells [4].\n*   Lh VLPs exhibit **heterogeneity in shapes, sizes, and spike numbers**, reminiscent of eukaryotic organelles, and mature outside the cells of origin [5].\n\n**Bacterial secretion system properties** are indicated by:\n*   The identification of **Lh-specific VLP proteins with sequence similarities to bacterial secretion system proteins** [1].\n*   An abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, **p40, shows structural similarities to needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram-negative bacterial Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SS)** [1], [6], [7], [8]. These bacterial proteins breach immune barriers and deliver virulence factors [7].\n*   **Prokaryotic protein motifs** were found in nearly 10% of novel Class 3 sequences, including Syd-like (Type 2 secretion systems) and flgE-like (bacterial flagellar hook) proteins [6].\n*   Some novel GTPase family members possess **prokaryotic domains** (e.g., PF09488) and their closest homologs are often prokaryotic [9].\n*   The hypothesis is that p40, like IpaD/SipD, facilitates invasive contact with host cell membranes to deliver VLP contents [8].\n*   The presence of prokaryotic-like (T3SS/flagellar-like) proteins hints at a shared evolutionary history or derivation of MSEV spikes from primordial flagellar/needle-like structures [10].",

They also exhibit heterogeneity in shapes, sizes, and spike numbers, similar to eukaryotic organelles [4].\n*   **Protein Composition**: The Lh VLP proteome consists of approximately **161 common proteins** categorized into three classes [5]:\n    1.  **Class 1 (42%)**: Conserved eukaryotic proteins with core biological functions, including orthologs of *Drosophila* and mammalian extra- and intracellular vesicle components, and membrane proteins [5]. This class includes transmembrane proteins (e.g., Na/K pump, SERCA calcium pump) and vesicle transport proteins (e.g., H+-ATPase, Rab proteins) [6].\n    2.  **Class 2 (24%)**: Virulence/immunity-associated proteins, such as diedel-like proteins (modulating IMD/NF-κB), enhancin-like proteins (similar to *Yersinia* spp. enhancins), imaginal disc growth factor 4-like, fire ant venom allergen, B-cell receptor-associated protein 31, knottin proteins, and juvenile hormone binding proteins [7], [8]. This class also includes RhoGAPs and metalloendopeptidases (MEPs) [8].\n    3.  **Class 3 (34%)**: Novel sequences, many of which are Lh-specific (not expressed by *Lb 17*) [5]. This class contains proteins with unexpected diversity of domains, including some previously found exclusively in prokaryotic proteins, and viral domains (Pox L5, Baculo_PEP_C, Baculo_11_kDa) [4], [9]. Notably, the abundant surface protein **p40** in Lh VLPs shows structural similarities to bacterial Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) needle-tip invasin proteins (SipD/IpaD) [2], [10].\n*   **Organelle Character**: Enrichment analyses show that 71% of VLP proteins with annotated orthologs are mitochondrial, with 12% localized to the inner membrane. Approximately 50% of conserved sequences are common to microvesicles/exosomes. Terms related to vesicular and mitochondrial components, including the pro-apoptotic caspase complex, are highly over-represented [11].\n*   **Distinctions**: Lh VLPs are explicitly distinguished from **viruses** (lack viral structural proteins and nucleic acids) and **endosymbiotic bacteria** (genomically encoded, non-replicating, unaffected by antibiotic treatment for *Wolbachia*) [4], [13]. Their unique composition and properties suggest they are not traditional viruses or bacteria but a novel class of microvesicle-like organelles [13].",
