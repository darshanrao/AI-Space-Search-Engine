          "answer_markdown": "Extended spaceflight significantly impacts the murine retina, leading to a range of molecular and structural alterations, as evidenced by changes in gene expression, structural integrity, and oxidative stress:\n\n**Gene Expression Changes**: RNA sequencing identified **600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** in murine spaceflight retinas, with **286 upregulated and 314 downregulated genes** [1], [3], [4]. These DEGs were significantly enriched for categories related to **visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories**, as well as various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions [1], [5], [6]. Notably, **12 DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa** [1], [7]. The study also highlighted changes in differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs), indicating alterations in **chromatin organization** through mechanisms like H3K9 demethylation, which can influence gene accessibility [8], [9], [10].\n\n**Structural Integrity**: Spaceflight resulted in a significant **decrease in the thickness of the total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid layers** of the eye, as measured by MicroCT [2], [11], [12]. Immunofluorescence assays showed **degradation of cone photoreceptors**, with a strong trend decrease in their density (from an average of 1199 counts/mm² in ground controls to 950 counts/mm² in spaceflight mice) [2], [13], [14]. Previous studies also indicated increased apoptosis in the outer and inner nuclear layers of photoreceptors in spaceflight mice [15].\n\n**Oxidative Stress**: Evidence of **increased retinal oxidative stress** was observed through elevated 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining in cone photoreceptors, the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) [2], [14], [16]. Gene expression data also indicated potential **compensatory mechanisms** against oxidative stress, with upregulation of genes like Bnip3 (involved in removing misfolded proteins) and heat shock genes (Hsp90aa1, Hsp90b1, Hspa4l) that assist in protein folding and protection against oxidative stress [17]. Conversely, the upregulation of Pde8a and downregulation of Hif1a and Hgf were linked to the development of increased oxidative stress in the retina [16], [18]. The study concludes that the space environment causes retinal injury and has the potential to lead to the development and progression of retinal degeneration [19]. Other factors like altered circadian rhythm were also observed [20].",
