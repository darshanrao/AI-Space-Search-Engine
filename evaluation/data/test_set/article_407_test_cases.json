          "answer_markdown": "The study found significant differences in assessing NK cell cytotoxicity depending on the assay protocol. In **traditional assays**, NK cells were exposed to simulated microgravity (sμG) for 48 hours, then centrifuged, and co-cultured with target cells under normal gravity (1G) for 4 hours [2, 3]. In contrast, the **continuous microgravity assay** maintained both NK cells and target tumor cells in a continuous state of sμG throughout the entire assay period [2, 4].\n\nWhen directly comparing these two methodologies for primary human NK cells against **MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells**, maintaining sμG throughout the entire assay procedure led to a **statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) further reduction in cytotoxicity** compared to the traditional assay [2]. This suggests that prior studies using traditional methods may have **underestimated the true reduction** in NK activity caused by microgravity, and that NK cells can **partially regain cytotoxic function** within as little as 4 hours when returned to normal gravity [2, 3].\n\nHowever, for **K-562 cells**, the cytotoxicity did **not differ significantly** between the two assay types [5, 6]. This lack of difference is attributed to K-562 cells' inherent high susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity due to reduced HLA class I expression and heightened expression of activating NK receptor ligands, which may mask subtle effects of stressors like continuous sμG [6].",

When cytotoxicity assays were performed under continuous sμG, the reduction in NK cell killing of MOLT-4 cells was **significantly further impaired** compared to traditional methods, suggesting NK cells partially regain function upon return to normal gravity [1, 5].\n*   **Molecular Mechanisms Identified:** RNA-seq analysis revealed that sμG significantly altered the expression of **2184 genes** in NK cells. These changes include the **up-regulation of multiple inhibitory transcripts** (e.g., CD1 isoforms, CD5, CD55, CD84, CD200, CD47, LAIR1, NFATC1, CD34) and the **down-regulation of activating receptors and pathways** (e.g., KLRC3/NKG2E, NOTCH2NLR, TNFRSF10C) [6, 7, 8]. The induction of CD34 suggests a potential regression of NK cells to an immature state, while increased CD8A could suppress T cell activation [7, 8].\n\n**Implications for Astronaut Cancer Risk:**\n*   **Increased Leukemogenesis Risk:** The reduced NK cytotoxicity, particularly against T-ALL cells, combined with prior research showing space radiation-induced human T-ALL, raises the **troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and microgravity may increase astronaut risk of hematological malignancies** during prolonged missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [1, 2, 9, 10].\n*   **Compromised Anti-tumor Immunity:** The observed deficits in NK function suggest that astronauts' immune systems may be less effective at recognizing and eliminating malignant clones that arise from space radiation-induced mutations [1, 11].\n*   **Need for Countermeasures:** The identification of specific altered molecular pathways provides a foundation for future research to **develop targeted medical countermeasures** to mitigate these microgravity-induced deficits and safeguard astronaut health [1, 11].",
