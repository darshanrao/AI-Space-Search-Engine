This is crucial for multi-investigator programs where tissues are harvested at remote sites (e.g., ISS) and then shipped to various labs, often after primary investigators have taken their samples [6]. For example, mouse reproductive tissues generally maintained histological integrity for 2.5-3 hours, while gerbil ovaries required processing within 1 hour [7], [8].\n\n2.  **Long-Term Storage Compatibility with ISS**: The study developed methods for **long-term storage (10 months at -80°C) in RNA later solution** that yield high-quality RNA and protein [2], [9], [10]. This is vital for spaceflight, as samples may be stored on the ISS for many months before return to Earth, spanning multiple return opportunities [1], [11]. RNA quality was preserved in tissues placed in RNA later up to **40 minutes after euthanasia** [12].\n\n3.  **Safe Shipping Protocols**: The regimen includes methods for **fixative removal and transfer of tissues into aqueous media (PBS) for safe international shipping**, and reconstitution protocols into 70% ethanol to retain excellent histology [3], [13]. This overcomes restrictions on shipping common fixatives like Bouin's (which contains picric acid) due to airline safety regulations [14], [15]. A **stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH** was found to cause less degradation than single-step changes [3].\n\nBy standardizing these processes, the regimen ensures that high-quality biological samples are available to all participating investigators, maximizing data generation from limited and valuable spaceflight animal payloads [1], [2], [16].",

          "answer_markdown": "This study aimed to develop a **comprehensive tissue retrieval and postharvest processing regimen** for rodent reproductive tissues (testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterus) [1], [2]. The primary objectives were to determine: \n1.  **Optimal species-specific and tissue-specific time windows** between euthanasia and fixation that preserve high-quality histology, RNA, and protein [3], [4].\n2.  **Methods for long-term tissue storage** (e.g., 10 months at -80°C) compatible with International Space Station (ISS) logistics and delayed sample return [3], [5].\n3.  **Standardized postfixation processing** for safe shipping to external laboratories, especially for multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs (BSP) [3], [6].\n\n**Experimental Design:**\nApproximately 8-week-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice and 10-month-old male and female Mongolian gerbils were used [7]. Animals were euthanized, and reproductive tissues were harvested at various time intervals (0 to 3 hours) post-euthanasia under different conditions: kept in the carcass at room temperature (RT), or immediately placed in Ham's F-10 medium on ice or at RT, before fixation in Bouin's solution [8], [9], [10]. Histological quality was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining [11]. Sperm motility (total and progressive) was analyzed using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) [12]. RNA integrity and quantity were determined using Agilent Bioanalyzer, and RT-PCR was performed for GAPDH and IL-1α [13]. Protein quality and expression (e.g., ERα, β-actin) were evaluated via Western blotting after extraction from tissues stored in RNA later [14], [15]. Post-fixation processing methods, including rapid vs. slow stepwise ethanol-PBS transitions, were also compared for histological preservation [16].\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   **Histological Stability:** Mouse testes maintained excellent histological properties up to **2.5-3 hours** after euthanasia [17], [18]. Mouse ovaries and uteri also showed excellent histology up to **3 hours** [19]. However, gerbil ovaries were more sensitive, showing signs of degradation (unhealthy follicles, shrunken oocytes, vacuoles) at **1.5 hours** and requiring harvest within **1 hour** of euthanasia [19], [20]. Gerbil sperm motility showed a suggestion of a slight drop at 2.5 hours, while mouse sperm motility was relatively stable across tested time points [21].\n*   **RNA and Protein Quality:** Tissues (e.g., ovaries, uteri) stabilized in **RNA later solution** and stored for **10 months at -80°C** yielded excellent RNA quality and high-quality protein suitable for Western blotting, with no evidence of proteolytic degradation [14], [15], [22]. High RNA quality was achieved if tissues were placed into RNA later up to **40 minutes after euthanasia** [23]. RNA later was superior to TRIzol for long-term storage and international shipping due to safety regulations [24].\n*   **Postfixation Processing:** A **slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH** preserved better testicular and epididymal morphology compared to rapid single-step solution changes, which resulted in poor histological quality [16], [25].\n*   **Shipping Compatibility:** New methods were developed for **replacing Bouin's fixative with 70% ethanol for safe domestic shipping** and **replacing 70% ethanol with PBS for safe international shipping**, while retaining excellent histology [2], [26].\n\nThese findings provide crucial protocols to ensure the integrity of valuable biological samples from spaceflight experiments, facilitating multi-investigator research and maximizing scientific data output [27].",

            "Primary objectives: Determine optimal tissue harvest windows, develop long-term storage methods, and standardize safe shipping protocols for spaceflight biospecimens.",
            "Experimental design involved C57Bl/6J mice and Mongolian gerbils, with reproductive tissues harvested at various post-euthanasia time points (0-3 hours) under different conditions.",
            "Histological quality, sperm motility, and RNA/protein integrity (after long-term RNA later storage) were assessed.",
            "Key finding: Mouse testes, ovaries, and uteri maintained excellent histology up to 2.5-3 hours post-euthanasia.",
            "Key finding: Gerbil ovaries were highly sensitive, showing degradation at 1.5 hours and requiring harvest within 1 hour.",
            "Key finding: Tissues stored in RNA later for 10 months at -80°C yielded high-quality RNA and protein.",
            "Key finding: RNA quality was preserved if tissues were placed in RNA later up to 40 minutes after euthanasia.",
            "Key finding: Stepwise rehydration-dehydration for Bouin's-fixed tissues preserved histology better than rapid transitions.",
            "Key finding: Protocols were developed for safe shipping by replacing Bouin's with 70% ethanol or PBS."
