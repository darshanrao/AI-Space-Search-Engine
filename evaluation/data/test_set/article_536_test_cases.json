Furthermore, *Klebsiella* species, particularly *K. pneumoniae*, are becoming increasingly **resistant to various antibiotics** like carbapenems, which could complicate treatment in space [2], [5]. The pathogenicity and resistance of these bacteria are a significant concern for astronaut safety [2], [5]. The whole-genome sequencing project aims to address these concerns by providing data for **comparative genomic studies** of ISS *Klebsiella* strains with their Earth counterparts.

Environmental samples were collected, brought to Earth, and aseptically handled. Aliquots were spread onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) agar (25°C for 7 days) or blood agar (37°C for 2 days) for microorganism isolation. Pure colonies were archived at −80°C until further analyses [2], [7].\n\n2.  **DNA Extraction**: Cultures of the 10 *Klebsiella* strains were grown overnight on tryptic soy agar at 25°C, followed by DNA extraction using the **ZymoBIOMICS DNA Magbead kit** [2], [7].\n\n3.  **Species Identification**: Bacterial species identity was determined by retrieving **16S rRNA gene sequences** from whole-genome sequences and performing BLAST analysis against type strains in the NCBI database. A similarity of **>97.5%** to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain confirmed identity [3], [8]. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculations were also performed using the **EZBioCloud ANI calculator** against listed type strains for phylogenic characterization [3], [4], [8], [9].\n\n4.  **Genome Sequencing**: Genomes were sequenced using the **Illumina Nextera Flex protocol** for library preparation and a **NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell** (paired end, 2 × 150 bp) for paired-end sequencing [4], [8].\n\n5.  **Bioinformatics Analysis**: Quality assessment was performed with **FastQC (v0.11.7)**. Adapter trimming and quality filtering were carried out with **fastp (v0.20.0)**. Sequences were assembled using **SPAdes (v3.11.1)**. The quality of the final sequences was assessed with **QUAST (v5.0.2)** to check N50 values, number of contigs, and total genome length [4], [5], [8].\n\n6.  **Data Deposition**: The whole-genome sequencing project data has been deposited in **GenBank** (GenBank and raw read accession numbers are in Table 1), with BioProject accession numbers **PRJNA635942, PRJNA640688, and PRJNA640693**. Whole-genome sequencing data has also been deposited in **NASA GeneLab** (accession numbers GLDS-302, GLDS-309, and GLDS-311) [4], [5], [6], [10].",
