While histological analysis showed no significant differences in mast cell counts, a small but significant increase in mast cell tryptase protein content was noted at 9 months after low-dose γ-irradiation or combined treatment, though this did not support extensive remodeling [4], [5].\n\nCompared to studies using higher radiation doses, which often report structural remodeling, the authors suggest two main reasons for their findings:\n1.  The **cumulative dose of 0.04 Gy radiation in the present experiment might have been too low** to elicit the cardiac remodeling that occurs at higher doses [2].\n2.

The exposures lasted 21 days, with cardiac tissue analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following completion of the treatment [1], [2], [3], [4].\n\nThe main categories of markers assessed were:\n*   **Oxidative stress**: Measured by GSH:GSSG ratios, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts, and antioxidant enzymes like manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase, and Nrf2 [1], [5], [6].\n*   **DNA methylation potential**: Assessed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) ratios and methionine levels [1], [5].\n*   **Cardiac remodeling and inflammatory cell infiltration**: Evaluated through α-smooth muscle cell actin, collagen type III protein content, total collagen deposition, mast cell numbers (histology and tryptase), and T-lymphocyte infiltration (CD-2 protein content) [1], [6], [7].\n\nKey findings include:\n*   **Oxidative Stress**: **GSH:GSSG ratios significantly decreased** 7 days and 1 month after HU or γ-irradiation, with the combined treatment showing a **further significant decrease at 7 days** [8], [9]. These differences were no longer apparent after 9 months, suggesting recovery [9]. No significant changes were observed in 4-HNE adducts, catalase, or Nrf2 expression at the measured endpoints [9]. A small reduction in MnSOD protein levels was seen 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation [9], [10].\n*   **DNA Methylation Potential**: **SAM:SAH ratios were significantly decreased** at 7 days and 1 month, with the combination group showing a **further decrement at 7 days** compared to either HU or γ-irradiation alone [11]. No significant differences were found at 9 months or in cardiac methionine content at any time point [11].\n*   **Cardiac Remodeling and Inflammation**: **No significant differences** were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content, or total collagen deposition at any measured endpoint, indicating **no significant cardiac remodeling** [9], [12]. While mast cell counts were unchanged, a **small but significant increase in mast cell tryptase protein content** was observed 9 months after low-dose γ-irradiation or combined treatment [13]. **CD-2 protein content (T-lymphocyte marker) was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment** compared to controls, but this difference was not present at 9 months [9], [14].\n\nOverall, the study suggests that the hearts had mostly recovered from these experimental conditions by the late observation time points, but highlights early alterations in oxidative stress and methylation potential, and a decrease in T-lymphocyte infiltration [9], [15].",
