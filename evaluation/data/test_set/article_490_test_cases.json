The study observed improvements in the functionality of the pharynx and intestine, which are not directly involved in the swimming motion [2], [3].\n\nSpecifically, the **pharyngeal pumping rate**, a cardiac-like muscle function, showed a significant increase in exercised animals at Ad11 and Ad15, which is 7 to 11 days after the last exercise session. This benefit became evident late in life, during a period of accentuated age-related decline [4]. For the **intestine**, long-term swim exercise improved intestinal barrier function, evidenced by a one-third lower proportion of \"Smurf animals\" (indicating reduced intestinal leakage) at Ad11 in exercised nematodes compared to controls [5].\n\nThese benefits to non-directly exercised tissues are suggested to be conferred via **transtissue signals** rather than direct exercise-enhanced contraction [3]. The paper highlights that early adult activity can trigger a **potential 'switch mechanism' for healthy aging trajectories** that extends late into life [2]. The establishment of *C. elegans* as an exercise model offers an exciting opportunity to uncover the **molecular signals and circuitry responsible for these life-long, exercise-dependent systemic health benefits** [1], [6].",

It also improves **burrowing performance** and maintains **healthier muscle mitochondrial network organization** [6], [7].\n*   **Metabolic Health**: Whole-animal mitochondrial function is enhanced, characterized by **increased maximal respiration, spare capacity, and ATP-linked respiration** [8].
