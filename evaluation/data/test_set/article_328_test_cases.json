It is suggested they play a **protective role in maintaining viral latency or inhibiting viral growth** [2].\n    *   **Oribacterium**: Produces **lactate**, which has shown potency in inactivating other viruses (HIV, Chlamydia) and could control viral titers [3]. Lactate also increases **hydrogen sulfide (H2S)** production by Veillonella [3].\n    *   **Veillonella**: A major H2S producer in the oral cavity, it had higher relative abundance in subjects who never experienced reactivation [4]. H2S is hypothesized to play a role in **maintaining viral latency** by protecting against pathogenic RNA viruses and antagonizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) effects [3], [4], [5]. H2O2 is a potent inducer of latent viral proteins [4].\n    *   **Haemophilus**: Also had higher relative abundance in subjects without reactivation [5]. It may protect the host by **utilizing H2O2**, which is produced by other salivary bacteria like Streptococcus mitis group [5], [6].\n\n**Promoting Mechanisms (associated with positive correlation to EBV viral load):**\n*   **Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia**: Strong positive correlations were found between EBV viral load and the relative abundances of Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia [1], [7]. Gracilibacteria was also the most predictive taxa for viral positive samples [7]. However, the specific mechanisms by which these two taxa could promote viral reactivation and/or replication are **not yet known** [8].",

          "answer_markdown": "This study, the first to examine the salivary microbiome's changes due to spaceflight and its link to viral reactivation, revealed several key findings:\n\n**Impact of Spaceflight on Salivary Microbiome:**\n*   **Alpha Diversity**: Overall microbiome diversity and richness (Shannon's diversity, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, and community richness) **increased significantly during spaceflight** but returned to pre-flight levels post-flight [1], [3].\n*   **Streptococcus Diversity**: In contrast to the collective microbiome, the diversity of **Streptococcus (the most abundant organism)** decreased during spaceflight and did not fully rebound post-flight [1], [4].\n*   **Beta Diversity**: No overall population-level differences in microbiome composition were observed [4], [6]. However, **individual-level analysis showed distinct microbiome changes** for 5 out of 10 astronauts, particularly those on their first mission [5], [7], [8].\n*   **Phyla and Genera Changes**: **Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria increased** in relative abundance during flight, while **Actinobacteria decreased** [1], [5]. Genera like **Catonella, Megasphaera, and Actinobacillus**, often absent pre-flight, were detected or increased in abundance during flight [1], [5].\n\n**Associations with Viral Reactivation (EBV and HSV-1):**\n*   **EBV vs. HSV-1**: Significant correlations were found between the microbiome and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) titers, but **not for Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1)** [1], [6].\n*   **Microbiome Richness**: There was a **significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers** [2], [6].\n*   **Correlative Genera**: \n    *   **Positive Correlation with EBV**: **Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia** showed the strongest positive correlation with EBV viral load, with Gracilibacteria being the most predictive taxa for viral positive samples [2], [6].\n    *   **Inverse Correlation with EBV**: **Oribacterium, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Haemophilus, Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum** showed the strongest inverse correlation with EBV viral load [2], [6]. These genera were also predictive of viral status, suggesting a protective role [2].\n*   **Bacterial Correlations and Viral Status**: Bacterial correlations at the phylum level were **more numerous in saliva samples devoid of EBV and HSV-1** compared to those with viral shedding [6].\n\nOverall, the study highlights that spaceflight significantly alters the salivary microbiome, and these changes are associated with viral reactivation, particularly EBV, suggesting potential bacterial biomarkers for predicting and mitigating viral disease in astronauts [2], [9].",
