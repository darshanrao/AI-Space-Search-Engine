          "answer_markdown": "The SI-NDVI system detects plant stress through a multi-step process involving specialized hardware and software:\n\n1.  **Image Capture**: A **GoPro Hero4 Black camera** retrofitted with a Back-Bone system and an **NDVI-7 filter** (allowing 400–575 nm and 675–775 nm light transmission) captures images [1], [2], [3]. A **Heliospectra LX300 lighting system** provides controlled **near-infrared (735 nm) and blue (450 nm) light** to the plant tissue [4], [5]. The camera's Protune settings are manually calibrated for consistent image quality [2].\n2.  **Image Processing**: Captured images are analyzed using the **Photo Monitoring plugin in Fiji image processing software** [6]. The software is configured to use the blue channel for the blue band and the red channel for the NIR band, as NIR reflectance is recorded in the camera's red channel [6].\n3.  **SI-NDVI Calculation**: The **SI-NDVI equation, (NIR - Blue) / (NIR + Blue)**, is applied to each individual pixel [7]. This generates SI-NDVI scores ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.\n4.  **Color Index and False Color Images**: The SI-NDVI scores are then divided into **256 \"color index values\"** (0-255), where each value corresponds to an increment of 0.0078125 in SI-NDVI scores [7]. False color images are produced by applying a customizable **color lookup table (LUT)** to these color index values, allowing visual representation of stress levels [7], [8].\n5.  **Quantitative Analysis**: For quantitative analysis, the system generates graphs displaying the number of pixels at each color index value [9]. Pixels with SI-NDVI scores between 0.00 and 1.00 (representing vegetative data) are specifically categorized, and background pixels are removed [9]. Changes in the curve of pixel counts over time indicate plant health or growth, allowing for early stress detection [9], [10].",
