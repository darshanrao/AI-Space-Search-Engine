This suggests that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing to increased susceptibility [1], [4].\n2.  **Bacterial Growth Kinetics**: Spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls *in vitro* and *in vivo* at later timepoints [1], [5]. The increased virulence was consistently accompanied by an increase in the bacterial growth rate within the fly host, particularly from 12 hours post-infection onwards [3], [5].\n3.  **Host Gene Expression**: RNA sequencing of wild-type flies infected with spaceflight bacteria showed few significant changes in host gene expression, particularly in known immune-related genes [6], [7]. Out of 11 differentially expressed genes, only **Attacin-A** was directly related to the immune response [8]. Principal component analysis (PCA) also showed significant overlap among treatment groups, indicating minimal differences in host gene expression [7].\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that the pathogen's physiological changes, such as enhanced growth kinetics, are the primary drivers of increased lethality, rather than a compromised host immune response [2].",

A vertical rotation served as a normal gravity control [1], [6].\n*   **Subculture Experiment**: To test reversibility, spaceflight and LSMMG-treated bacteria were subcultured overnight under normal Earth gravity conditions before injection into flies [1], [7].\n\n**Host Model and Infection**:\n*   **Drosophila melanogaster**: Wild-type (w1118) and immune pathway mutant flies (Imd and Toll pathways) were used to assess host immune response [1], [3], [8].\n*   **Infection**: 2-3 day-old female flies were injected in the ventrolateral abdomen with approximately **10 CFU/fly** of treated bacteria diluted in PBS, or a sterile sham control [4], [9].\n\n**Key Measurements**:\n*   **Host Survival**: Monitored hourly for at least 24 hours post-injection, analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazards model [9], [10].\n*   **In vivo Bacterial Load**: Assayed in flies at 0, 9, 12, and 15 hours post-injection by homogenizing flies and plating serial dilutions on LB agar [10].\n*   **Host Gene Expression**: RNA sequencing was performed on wild-type flies 18 hours post-infection to identify differentially expressed genes related to host immunity [8], [11].\n\nThis comprehensive design aimed to compare virulence and growth kinetics under true spaceflight and simulated microgravity, assess the reversibility of these effects, and determine whether host immunity or pathogen physiology was primarily responsible for observed changes [1], [2].",
