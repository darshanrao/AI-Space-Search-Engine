In γ-SG -/- muscles, there is an **elevated basal p70S6K activation** even at rest [1], [2]. More critically, while C57 (wild-type) muscles show a transient increase in p70S6K phosphorylation that decreases after 90 minutes of stretch, γ-SG -/- muscles exhibit a **sustained and further increased activation** of p70S6K (at both T389 and T421/S424 sites) over the same period [1], [3]. This sustained activation suggests that the loss of γ-SG **uncouples the normal p70S6K response to stretch** and that γ-SG is crucial for the **inactivation** of this pathway [4], [5], [6].\n\nProposed molecular mechanisms for this altered regulation include the hypothesis that γ-SG is required for the **dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6K** [2]. This could occur through γ-SG mediating the activation of specific phosphatases, such as **protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)** or **PHLPP**, which are known to directly dephosphorylate p70S6K. Alternatively, γ-SG might indirectly regulate pathways that deactivate p70S6K, for instance, by influencing the phosphatase **SHP-2**, which can cause mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of p70S6K [2], [6]. Therefore, γ-SG's role as a mechanosensor likely involves modulating p70S6K activation, potentially through regulating ERK1/2 or these phosphatases [6].",

          "answer_markdown": "This study aimed to elucidate the role of **γ-sarcoglycan (γ-SG)** in mechanotransduction, specifically how its absence alters the response of **p70S6 kinase (p70S6K)** to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle, with implications for muscular dystrophies [1], [2].\n\n**Experimental Models and Key Findings:**\n1.  **C2C12 myotubes**: Initial experiments using C2C12 myotubes subjected to cyclic passive stretch revealed a **robust increase in p70S6K phosphorylation (T389)**, while ERK1/2, Akt, and FAK showed no or decreased responses. This suggested an Akt- and integrin-independent p70S6K activation pathway responsive to stretch [3], [4].\n2.  **Primary myotube cultures (C57 and γ-SG -/- )**: These cultures showed variable results. While C57 cultures displayed a trend for increased p70S6K activation after stretch, γ-SG -/- cultures did not show an apparent p70S6K response, and the system was deemed too variable for firm conclusions regarding γ-SG-dependent mechanical signaling [1], [5].\n3.  **Isolated Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) muscles (C57 and γ-SG -/- )**: This model provided the most significant findings. Resting γ-SG -/- EDL muscles exhibited an **elevated basal p70S6K phosphorylation** (approximately 1.7-fold) and an 8-fold increase in downstream S6RP phosphorylation compared to C57 muscles [6]. Upon passive stretching, p70S6K activation increased in both genotypes. However, after 90 minutes of stretch, p70S6K phosphorylation (T389 and T421/S424) **decreased in C57 muscles but remained elevated or further increased in stretched γ-SG -/- muscles** [7]. This sustained activation in γ-SG -/- muscles strongly implied that **γ-sarcoglycan is required for the inactivation of p70S6K** following mechanical stimulation [2], [8], [9].\n\n**Regulation Mechanisms:**\n*   **Calcium Independence**: The elevated basal p70S6K phosphorylation in γ-SG -/- muscles was found to be **independent of both extracellular and intracellular calcium** [10], [11]. This contrasts with ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was calcium-dependent, suggesting p70S6K changes are a more direct consequence of γ-SG absence [10], [12].\n*   **mTOR Dependence and Rapamycin Sensitivity**: p70S6K T389 phosphorylation was largely mTOR-dependent in both genotypes, as rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) blocked or abrogated most of this phosphorylation. However, interestingly, **S6RP phosphorylation in stretched γ-SG -/- muscles was preserved despite rapamycin treatment**, suggesting an alternative, p70S6K-bypassing pathway for S6RP phosphorylation in the absence of γ-SG [13], [14].\n\n**Implications for Muscular Dystrophies:**\nThe study concludes that the loss of γ-sarcoglycan leads to **altered load-sensing mechanisms** in muscular dystrophies, where γ-SG is a crucial component of mechanotransduction [2], [15]. This inappropriate load sensing contributes significantly to the pathology of diseases like Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) [15]. Understanding these disrupted functions and involved pathways is vital for designing effective therapies [8], [15]. While the precise contribution of enhanced p70S6K activation to pathology (whether detrimental or compensatory) remains unclear, its inhibition by glucocorticoids (used in DMD/LGMD treatment) and the observed effects of mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin on dystrophic phenotypes highlight its therapeutic relevance [16].",
