Some off-nominal events with the thermal control subsystem also led to temperature increases beyond the **21°C** set point. Additionally, erroneous measurements (showing 0°C) occurred due to communication issues [2], [3].\n*   **Relative Humidity**: The FEG experienced larger deviations from the **65%** set point, particularly between April and July, where relative humidity would go as high as **86%** for periods of a few hours. This was attributed to issues with the condensate recovery design, which required mitigation through adjustments to flow rates, coolant temperatures, and control logic [3], [4].\n*   **CO2 Concentration**: The CO2 concentration within the FEG was almost always higher than the **1000 ppm** set point. This was primarily due to the on-site operator frequently (almost every day) working inside the greenhouse and emitting CO2, coupled with the absence of a CO2 removal system. Depending on the time spent inside, CO2 levels could rise to **~2000 ppm or even ~4000 ppm**, taking approximately one day for plants to consume enough CO2 to return to the set point [4].",

Its primary purpose is to enable food production during space missions to reduce resupply mass and costs, while also producing oxygen, removing carbon dioxide, and recycling water [1], [2], [3].\n\n*   **Location**: The MTF is situated in **Antarctica**, approximately **400 m south** of the German Neumayer Station III. This continent provides several conditions favorable for space analog test campaigns [2], [3], [4].\n\n*   **Physical Structure**: The MTF is constructed from **two customized 20-foot high cube shipping containers** placed on a raised platform. It is divided into three distinct sections [4], [5]:\n    1.  **Airlock/Cold-Porch (Blue section)**: A small room for storage, an air buffer to limit cold air entry, and houses the main fresh and waste water tanks [4], [6].\n    2.  **Service Section (Red section)**: Contains the primary control, atmosphere management, thermal control, power control, and nutrient delivery systems, along with a work desk and storage [6], [7].\n    3.  **Future Exploration Greenhouse (FEG) (Green section)**: The main plant cultivation space, featuring multi-level plant growth racks operating in a controlled environment to study plant cultivation and related technologies for future planetary habitats [7], [8].\n\n*   **Main Subsystems**: The MTF integrates six key subsystems to manage the controlled environment for plant cultivation [8]:\n    1.  **Nutrient Delivery Subsystem**: Adjusts the irrigation water's pH and EC, provides dedicated nutrient solutions (leafy or fruit-building crop specific) directly to the roots via high-pressure pumps spraying a fine mist [9], [10].\n    2.  **Atmosphere Management Subsystem**: Regulates temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration within the FEG. It also filters air (particle, HEPA, activated carbon) and recovers humidity condensate water for reuse [10].\n    3.  **Thermal Control Subsystem**: Removes excess heat from the MTF and provides a cool fluid for condensation of plant-produced humidity [11].\n    4.  **Illumination Control Subsystem**: Comprises 42 fluid-cooled LED fixtures within the FEG, allowing independent control of light spectrum (red, blue, far-red, white) and intensity for each plant tray [11].\n    5.  **Power Distribution Subsystem**: Supplies electrical energy to all MTF subsystems, with power generated at the Neumayer Station III [12].\n    6.  **Control and Data Handling Subsystem**: Consists of independent programmable logic controllers that receive sensor data, control MTF functions, send system telemetry to a mission control center in Bremen, Germany, and transmit daily images for remote expert monitoring and assistance to the on-site operator [12], [13].",
