Quantitatively, the brain transcriptome distance between CS and FL (S CS/FL = **747.25**) is significantly smaller than between HU and FL (S HU/FL = **1756.26**), underscoring this closer similarity [7], [8].\n\nWhile there was minimal overlap in differentially expressed genes among all three models, the CS model shared **eight genes** (Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1) with the FL model, whereas the HU model only shared **two genes** (Serpinc1 and Ccl19) with the FL model. Notably, no shared differentially expressed genes were identified between the CS and HU models [5].\n\nIn terms of KEGG pathways, the **GnRH signaling pathway** was commonly altered across all three models. Additionally, the CS and FL models shared two more pathways: **Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction** and **Ovarian steroidogenesis**.
