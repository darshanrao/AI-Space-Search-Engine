The comprehensive workflow involved several key stages:\n\n1.  **Read Generation and Error Correction:** Initially, **78,692 PacBio reads** were obtained, with a mean length of 3,850 bp. These raw reads underwent error correction using the **PacBio RS_PreAssembler.1 module**, which yielded 10,736 error-corrected reads with an average length of 6,421 bp [1], [4].\n2.  **Genome Assembly:** A single scaffold was assembled directly from these error-corrected reads utilizing **Celera assembler (CA) version 7.0 software** [1], [4].\n3.  **Assembly Refinement:** The initial genome assembly was further refined using the **PacBio RS_Resequencing.1 module with Quiver consensus calling**. This step was crucial for removing residual sequencing errors and producing the final, high-quality consensus genome sequence [1], [4].\n4.  **ORF Prediction and Annotation:** Open reading frame (ORF) prediction and subsequent annotation were performed through the **Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) pipeline**, employing **GLIMMER** [2], [5]. This process identified **2,152 protein-encoding ORFs** on the circular chromosome, with 1,697 (79%) assigned to known functions and 455 (21%) to unknown functions [3], [5]. Additionally, 1,841 ORFs (86%) were assigned to Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) categories using the Batch Web CD-Search tool [3], [5].\n5.  **RNA Identification:** Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) were identified using the 'search_for_RNAs' script and tRNAscan-SE, respectively, leading to the detection of **74 tRNAs and 8 rRNA operons** [3], [5].",
