This cellular response could impair the barrier function of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and compromise intraocular pressure regulation, potentially affecting visual acuity and increasing the risk of late retinal degeneration [3], [4].\n2.  **Oxidative Stress**: While a direct lipid peroxidation marker (4-HNE) was not significantly altered in this specific study's post-flight measurements, the paper notes that previous studies and proteomic analysis suggest spaceflight is associated with **elevations in oxidative stress** [5]. Several oxidative stress-related signaling pathways, including fatty acid β-oxidation I, fatty acid activation, and α-adrenergic pathways, were significantly altered in the microgravity group [2], [5].\n3.  **Altered Protein Expression and Pathways**: Proteomic analysis revealed significant alterations in key canonical pathways responsible for **cell death, cell repair, inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation** [2]. Specific protein changes include:\n    *   **MECP2** (Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) showed the highest fold-change increase in microgravity mice [6]. This protein is involved in regulating chromatin structure and transcription, is primarily expressed in post-mitotic neurons, and has been linked to epigenetic regulation of senescent endothelial progenitor cells, apoptosis, and neurodegeneration [6], [7].\n    *   **CLIP2** (Cap-Gly domain containing linker protein 2), which plays a role in neuronal structure, function, and cytoskeleton regulation, was significantly down-regulated in both microgravity and artificial gravity groups [6].\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that spaceflight induces changes in neuronal structure, cellular organization, mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, and inflammation, which may ultimately lead to tissue injury and neurodegeneration [5].",

The researchers hypothesized that spaceflight would induce oxidative stress and apoptosis, alter ocular proteins, and that AG would counteract these changes [2].\n\n**Experimental Design**: Twelve 9-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for a **35-day mission** [4], [5]. They were divided into two flight groups: one exposed to **ambient microgravity (μg)** and another to **continuous 1g artificial gravity (μg + 1g)** using a short-arm centrifuge within a specialized habitat cage unit (HCU) [4], [5]. Ground control groups included habitat controls (HC) and vivarium controls [5]. After the mission, retinal tissue was analyzed for apoptosis using TUNEL assay, oxidative damage using 4-HNE immunohistochemistry, and protein expression profiles were determined using high-resolution mass spectrometry and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) [4], [6].\n\n**Main Findings**: \n*   **Apoptosis**: Spaceflight under microgravity conditions induced **significant apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells**, with the density of apoptotic cells being **64% greater** than in habitat controls [6], [7]. Crucially, the application of 1g AG significantly **reduced this apoptosis**, with the μg + 1g group showing levels comparable to controls [6], [8].\n*   **Oxidative Stress**: While no significant difference in the lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE was detected two days after splash-down in this study [6], proteomic analysis revealed significant alterations in **oxidative stress-related signaling pathways** in the μg group [8].\n*   **Protein Expression Profiles**: Proteomic analysis identified **77 significant proteins** differentially expressed in the μg group versus habitat controls, affecting pathways related to **cell death, cell repair, inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation** [9], [10]. In contrast, only **23 significant proteins** were found in the μg + 1g group versus habitat controls, demonstrating AG's protective effect [10]. Specific proteins like MECP2 (upregulated) and CLIP2 (downregulated) were significantly altered in microgravity, impacting cell survival, neurological function, and cellular organization [11], [12].\n\n**Overall Conclusions**: The study concludes that spaceflight induces **apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells of the retina** and causes **acute changes in retinal protein expression profiles**, suggesting broader impacts on eye structure and function [8], [13]. These alterations could impair the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) function, affect intraocular pressure regulation, and potentially contribute to visual acuity impairments and late retinal degeneration in astronauts [4], [14]. The application of **1g artificial gravity during spaceflight was effective in mitigating some of these detrimental effects**, including reducing endothelial cell damage and maintaining cellular organization and function [8], [12], [13]. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and long-term consequences [13].",
