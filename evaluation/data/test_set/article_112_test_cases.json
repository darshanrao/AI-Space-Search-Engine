          "answer_markdown": "The **NASA GeneLab platform** is an interactive, open-access omics database, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository, designed for users to upload, download, share, store, and analyze data from spaceflight and space-relevant experiments. Its primary purpose is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology and to discover mechanisms essential for astronaut health during deep space exploration [1], [2].\n\nThe general methodology employed in this review to identify and analyze differentially expressed genes involved several steps:\n1.  **Identification of Microarray Studies:** All microarray studies and datasets housed in NASA GeneLab were identified using specific search filters for \"Assay Type: Microarray\" and \"Organisms: Mus musculus OR Human (Homo sapiens)\", limited to studies published up to January 2023 [3], [4]. Additional searches were conducted on academic databases like PubMed and ScienceDirect, though GeneLab already encompasses relevant GEO data [5].\n2.  **Comparative Meta-analysis Focus:** The study primarily focused on the **musculoskeletal system** for comparative meta-analysis, chosen because it encompasses a wide range of tissue types highly comparable between human and mouse datasets [6].\n3.  **Inclusion Criteria for Reproducible Genes:** To identify differentially expressed genes reproducible between experiments, specific inclusion criteria were applied: (1) case–control study, (2) derived from musculoskeletal tissue of the same species, (3) untreated samples, and (4) microgravity vs. control group comparison [7].\n4.  **Differential Expression Analysis:** Genes were identified as differentially expressed if they met an adjusted P value (Benjamini–Hochberg method) threshold of below **0.05** and a |log2FC| threshold above **1**, reflecting a substantial change in gene expression [8].\n5.  **Data Preprocessing and Quality Control:** Data preprocessing and differential expression analysis procedures were conducted using the R programming language. Normalization was performed using the RMA algorithm for Affymetrix datasets (via affy or oligo packages) and the limma package for Agilent datasets. Quality control checks, including outlier removal based on MA and PCA plots, were also executed [8], [9].\n6.  **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between gene counts in different datasets from the same tissue type to demonstrate concordance on a gene-by-gene level [7].",
