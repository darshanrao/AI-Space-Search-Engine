          "answer_markdown": "Achieving true semantic interoperability and data reusability in omics data systems faces several primary challenges, particularly concerning metadata:\n\n1.  **Lack of Semantic Metadata Representation:** Systems often do not use metadata representation languages with sufficient semantics, nor do they fully leverage FAIR vocabularies. Existing metadata specifications lack inherent semantics, making semantic integration difficult [1], [2], [3].\n2.  **Myriad and Overlapping Vocabularies:** There are numerous vocabularies (ontologies) within biological sub-domains, often with overlapping semantic content, which necessitates complex normalization mechanisms. Reliably mapping these ever-changing ontologies is a significant hurdle [1], [4].\n3.  **Low Motivation for Rich Metadata Provision:** Data submitters in the biomedical field have relatively low motivation to provide extensive, rich metadata, partly because only a small fraction of shared data is cited upon reuse. This places a burden on systems with limited resources to acquire and maintain quality metadata [4].\n4.  **Absence of Formal Semantic Schemas and Maps:** Data systems define metadata differently, and none make their schemas available in formal semantic language formats (like RDF or OWL). This requires manual creation of semantic maps for federated querying, which is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain as data sources evolve [5], [6].\n5.  **Lack of Community Semantic Resources:** There is a general lack of available semantic resources developed by the community to generate metadata specifications and vocabularies, especially in newer omics domains. This extends to processed data and analysis workflows, where domain-specific semantics are often missing, hindering their discovery and reuse [2], [7], [8].\n6.  **Difficulty in Semantic Data Linking:** Semantically linking data between different systems is a challenging objective. It requires either time-consuming manual linking by subject matter experts or automated linking, which depends on both source and linked data being semantically characterized, a capability that is largely still forthcoming [9].",

This approach aims to provide flexibility, meet organizational policy requirements, and support access for a wide range of users [1].\n\nSpecifically, an ICAA allows for technical compatibility between authentication services and the ICAA itself, facilitated by authentication protocols and standards. It also requires compatibility of credentialing policies between organizations [1]. For instance, NASA is developing an ICAA that permits intramural users to use internal services while allowing extramural users to authenticate via a defined set of externally-managed credentialing systems, such as Google.com credentials [2]. This enables extramural users to gain almost immediate access with minimal information (e.g., a verifiable email address), albeit with appropriate access controls for certain functions due to a lower level of authentication confidence [3]. The paper suggests this as an additional principle (A1.2.1) for FAIR data systems to maximize access [4].",

They used 14 FAIRness metrics from the current working draft developed by the GO FAIR Metrics group. The assessment was semi-quantitative, with systems rated as **Pass** (no evidence of failure), **Partial Pass** (passed some but not all components, or inconsistent passes), or **Fail** (no evidence of compliance). An overall FAIRness score was calculated by assigning 1 for each Pass, 0.5 for each Partial Pass, and 0 for each Fail [3], [4].\n\n**Overall Findings:**\nThere was considerable variability in FAIRness among the assessed systems. The overall FAIRness scores ranged from **6 to 12** (out of 14), with an average of **10.1** and a standard deviation of 2.4. The percentage of Pass ratings ranged from 29-79%, Partial Pass from 0-21%, and Fail from 7-50% [2], [5].\n\nComparatively, the systems performed **best in the areas of data accessibility and reusability**, were **slightly worse in data findability**, and performed **far worse in data interoperability** [2], [5]. Specifically, the reusability of metadata was frequently not well supported [2].",
