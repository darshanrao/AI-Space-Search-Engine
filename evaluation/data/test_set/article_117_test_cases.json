To specifically address and account for the potential direct effects of estrogen on bone cells, the researchers performed **regression analyses in groups with low circulating estrogen levels** [1], [4], [5], [6]. These groups included young ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and old intact and old OVX rats [1], [4].\n\nIn these low-estrogen groups, there was **no significant relation between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen or uterine mass** (a biomarker for reproductive hormone status), indicating that the direct effects of estrogen on cancellous bone volume were negligible [1], [4], [5], [6]. However, even in these groups, a **significant association between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume** was observed [1], [4], [5], [6]. This finding supports the concept of a vascular coupling mechanism, suggesting that the bone vasculature can modulate bone cell activity independently of direct estrogen effects on bone [1], [2], [3]. This conclusion is further supported by studies in humans showing a positive correlation between forearm conduit artery endothelial vasodilator responsiveness and lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [2].",

Estrogen replacement (OVX+E2) **restored both vasodilation and BV/TV** to levels comparable to intact animals [1], [4].\n*   **In old rats**: OVX had **no effect on circulating estrogen levels, endothelium-dependent vasodilation, or trabecular bone volume** [2], [4], [5]. However, the addition of exogenous estrogen (OVX+E2) **elevated endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increased bone volume** [2], [4], [5].\n*   **Correlation**: Across both age groups, **estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume** [1], [2], [4].\n*   **Vascular Coupling Mechanism**: Crucially, in groups with low endogenous estrogen (young OVX, old intact, and old OVX), where direct estrogen effects on cancellous bone volume were negligible, a **significant association between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume** was still observed [6], [7], [8]. These findings collectively support a **vascular coupling mechanism** linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling, suggesting that the bone vasculature can modulate bone cell activity [2], [4], [9].",
