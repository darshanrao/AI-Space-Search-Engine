This trafficking defect is not a secondary result of compromised root development [2].\n2.  **Impaired auxin transport:** Hours after the PIN mislocalization, **auxin transport becomes impaired**. For instance, shootward IAA transport significantly decreases within **8 hours** of transfer to 25°C [4], [5]. This leads to reduced long-distance rootward transport and impaired shootward progression of auxin [6].\n3.  **Physiological defects:** Following the disruption of auxin transport, **gravitropism and root developmental defects** become evident. Gravitropic response is significantly inhibited after **8-12 hours** at the restrictive temperature [2], [7]. Root elongation shows a significant decrease starting around **5 hours** after transfer [7], and lateral root developmental defects can be quantified **days** after the transition [1]. This demonstrates that the disruption of PIN protein localization directly precedes and causes the observed reductions in auxin transport and subsequent physiological processes [1], [8].",

SCD1 encodes a **RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RAB-GEF)** involved in endocytosis and exocytosis [3], [4].\n\nThe main findings are:\n\n1.  **Temperature-dependent phenotypes:** At the restrictive temperature of **25°C**, *scd1-1* mutants exhibit a suite of developmental and physiological defects, including **impaired primary root elongation**, **reduced lateral root formation**, and **inhibited gravity response** [5], [6], [7]. These phenotypes are not observed at the permissive temperature of 18°C and are reversible upon temperature shifts [2], [8].\n2.  **Disrupted PIN protein trafficking:** The core molecular defect is the **mislocalization of PIN proteins**, specifically **PIN1-GFP and PIN2-GFP**, which accumulate in **endomembrane bodies** (identified as late/multivesicular endosomes) at 25°C instead of their normal plasma membrane localization [1], [9], [10], [11]. This trafficking defect is rapid, becoming apparent within **minutes** of transition to the restrictive temperature [2], [12].\n3.  **Impaired polar auxin transport:** The altered PIN localization leads to **reduced polar auxin transport** in both rootward and shootward directions [13], [14], [15]. This reduction in auxin transport is observed **hours** after the initial PIN mislocalization [2], [12].\n4.  **Causal linkage:** The study provides **direct evidence that the disruption of PIN protein localization precedes and causes the reductions in auxin transport and the subsequent auxin transport-dependent physiological processes** like gravitropism and lateral root development [2], [16]. For example, PIN2 mislocalization occurs within minutes, while auxin transport defects are measured hours later, and root developmental defects days later [2].\n5.  **Specificity of SCD1 targets:** SCD1's effect appears selective, primarily affecting PIN1 and PIN2 trafficking, while the localization of other auxin transporters like PIN3, ABCB19, and AUX1 was not significantly altered in *scd1-1* mutants [10].\n\nIn essence, SCD1 is crucial for maintaining the proper trafficking and plasma membrane localization of key PIN auxin efflux carriers, which in turn ensures efficient polar auxin transport and the normal progression of root development and gravitropic responses in *Arabidopsis thaliana* [16].",
