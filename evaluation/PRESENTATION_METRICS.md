## üîç **Detailed Metric Explanations**

### Retrieval Metrics
- **Strict Recall**: Percentage of critical documents successfully retrieved
- **Soft Recall**: Percentage of critical + recommended documents retrieved
- **Retrieval Score**: Average of strict and soft recall

### Answer Metrics
- **Semantic Similarity**: Cosine similarity between generated answer and ground truth (0-1 scale)
- **Key Facts Coverage**: Percentage of essential facts included in the answer
- **Answer Score**: Average of semantic similarity and key facts coverage

### Citation Metrics
- **Precision**: Percentage of RAG citations that are actually relevant
- **Recall**: Percentage of ground truth citations that appear in RAG output
- **Accuracy**: Format validation (PASS/FAIL)
- **Citation Score**: Average of precision, recall, and accuracy

### Overall Score Formula
```
Overall Score = (0.35 √ó Retrieval) + (0.45 √ó Answer) + (0.20 √ó Citation)
```
*Weights prioritize answer quality (what users see) while valuing strong retrieval as the foundation.*
